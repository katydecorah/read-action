# read-action

![Test](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=main) [![Read](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action/actions/workflows/read.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action/actions/workflows/read.yml)

This GitHub action tracks the books that you read by updating a JSON file in your repository. Pair it with the [iOS Shortcut](shortcut/README.md) to automatically trigger the action or click **Run workflow** from the Actions tab to submit details about the book.

[Create a workflow dispatch event](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event) with information about the book. The action will then fetch the book's metadata using [node-isbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-isbn) and commit the change in your repository, always sorting by the date you finished the book.

## Book status

There are three statuses a book can have:

1. `want to read` - to mark a book as one that you want to read, do not send a `dateStarted` or `dateFinished` in your payload.
2. `started` - to mark a book as started, add `dateStarted` in your payload.
3. `finished` - to mark a book as finished, add `dateFinished` in your payload.

If you mark a book as "want to read" you can update it to "started" by sending another payload with the same ISBN and `dateStarted`. Similarily, if you marked a book as "want to read" or "started", send a new payload with the same book ISBN and `dateFinished` to mark the book as finished.

## Set up the workflow

To use this action, create a new workflow in `.github/workflows` and modify it as needed:
